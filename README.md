# University-Website-Project
This is my first year university website project. It was for a fictional medical centre called "Healers".
I'm a university student currently attending Griffith University, Nathan Campus.
This is a test repository.

Things to Do
I need to sort out which scripts are correct.
I made different versions for testing etc and never got around to deleting them due to time constraints.
